# AE370-Energy-Dissipation-in-a-Guitar-String

## This repository contains the code we used to simulate the behavior of a string clamped on both ends under various conditions using finite difference methods. This model simulates the behavior of a guitar string and is useful in modeling energy dissipation within similar systems. The following is a description of our three jupyter notebook files, to be viewed in this order:
