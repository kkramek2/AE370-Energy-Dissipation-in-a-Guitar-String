# AE370-Energy-Dissipation-in-a-Guitar-String
This repository contains the code we used to simulate the behavior of a string clamped on both ends under various conditions using finite difference methods. This model simulates the behavior of a guitar string and is useful in modeling energy dissipation within similar systems. The following is a description of our three Jupyter Notebook files, to be viewed in this order:

(1) Undamped Solution - describes the vibration of a string starting from a plucked position with no damping. This code represents our implementation of the Method of Lines and Newmark-beta. Plots of displacement and total energy are included and discussed.

(2) Damped Solution - uses the Method of Lines and Newmark-beta to simulate the vibration of a string starting from a plucked position with damping. Plots of displacement and total energy are also included and discussed.

(3) Error Analysis - includes discussion and plots of numerical convergence for the undamped vibrating string problem described in (1).
